    "In this lecture we will begin to delve deeper into using Spark and Python. Please view the video lecture for a full explanation.\n",

    "## Creating an RDD\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common ways to create an RDD:<br>\n",

    "## RDD Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use transformations to create a set of instructions we want to preform on the RDD (before we call an action and actually execute them).\n",

    "|Transformation Example \t|Result\n",
    "|----|-------|\n",
    "|filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0) |Discard non-even elements\n",

    "|sortBy(lambda x: x, ascending=False) |\tSort elements in descending order\n",
    "\n",
    "## RDD Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your 'recipe' of transformations ready, what you will do next is execute them by calling an action. Here are some common actions:\n",

    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the best way to show all of this is by going through examples! We'll first review a bit by creating and working with a simple text file, then we will move on to more realistic data, such as customers and sales data.\n",
